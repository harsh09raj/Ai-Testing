### config.py

High-level purpose
- This file is the central place where the app’s settings live and are loaded. Instead of hard-coding secrets and options across the codebase, everything is defined and read here in one place.

What it does
- Defines a Config class that:
  1) Starts with sensible default settings for the app.
  2) Loads your custom settings from a config.json file (if provided).
  3) Overrides those with environment variables (so you can keep secrets out of source control and customize per environment).
  4) Validates that required values are present and correctly formed (for example, that API keys exist before the app runs).

What parts of the app it configures
- OpenAI/Azure OpenAI settings:
  - api_key: your key for calling the model.
  - model and deployment_name: which model to use and (if using Azure OpenAI) the deployment name.
  - max_tokens, temperature, timeout: how the model should behave and how long to wait.
- Microsoft Teams settings:
  - webhook_url: where to send release notes.
  - channel_name, mention_users, enable_notifications: how notifications are posted.
- Git settings:
  - default_branch: which branch to compare against (e.g., main).
  - ignore_patterns and file_extensions: which files/folders to skip or include when scanning changes for release notes.

How it fits in the project
- The project is an “Automate Release Notes” tool. It likely:
  - Reads changes from your Git repo.
  - Uses OpenAI to summarize those changes into release notes.
  - Posts the notes to a Teams channel via a webhook.
- This Config class is the foundation that other parts of the app rely on to know:
  - Which repo branch to use.
  - How to authenticate to OpenAI.
  - Where to send messages in Teams.
  - Any limits, timeouts, or behavior tweaks.

How it works when the app starts
1) Somewhere in your code you do: config = Config() (optionally passing a path to a different config file).
2) The class loads defaults, then merges in values from config.json, and then applies any environment variable overrides.
3) It validates that critical settings (like api keys or the Teams webhook if notifications are enabled) are present.
4) Other modules read settings from config, for example:
   - config.config['openai']['api_key']
   - config.config['teams']['webhook_url']
   - config.config['git']['default_branch']

Why this structure is helpful
- Centralized: One source of truth for configuration.
- Safe: Secrets can be provided via environment variables instead of living in source code.
- Portable: Easy to switch between local dev, CI, and production by changing env vars or a config file.
- Predictable: Defaults make it work out-of-the-box; validation catches misconfigurations early.

What you typically provide
- A config.json in the project root with non-secret defaults (e.g., model, branch).
- Environment variables for secrets:
  - OPENAI_API_KEY
  - TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL
- Optional environment overrides for behavior:
  - OPENAI_TEMPERATURE, OPENAI_TIMEOUT, etc.

Notes about the snippet you shared
- The file sets up default dictionaries for openai, teams, and git.
- It imports os (used for reading environment variables), Path for file paths, and typing hints for clarity.
- The _validate_config method is referenced but not shown; it likely checks that required fields are present and consistent.
---### generate_docs_and_release.py

High-level purpose
- This script is an automation helper that generates simple, human‑readable documentation and release notes for the code in your app directory.
- It uses Azure OpenAI to read files and produce beginner‑friendly explanations, then saves those write‑ups in the app folder. It’s meant to keep documentation and release notes up to date with minimal manual effort.

What it does (step by step)
- Loads settings from a .env file:
  - OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_BASE, OPENAI_API_VERSION, OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME: needed to talk to Azure OpenAI.
  - TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL: if present, can be used to send a message to Microsoft Teams (the snippet shows it being read; actual posting would happen elsewhere in the script).
- Configures the OpenAI client to use Azure’s flavor of the API (api_type='azure') and points it at your specific deployment (engine=deployment).
- summarize_file(filepath):
  - Opens a file safely (handles encoding issues).
  - Reads the first ~1500 characters so it doesn’t send huge files to the AI model.
  - Builds a clear prompt asking the model to explain what the file is for and how it fits into the project, in beginner‑friendly language.
  - Calls Azure OpenAI’s chat completion API to get that explanation back.
- The docstring and imports suggest the rest of the script (not shown in the snippet) does two more things:
  - Only looks at files inside the app/ directory and writes the generated documentation there.
  - Assembles release notes (likely from recent changes) and may optionally notify a Microsoft Teams channel via the webhook.

How it fits into the project
- It’s part of your documentation/release workflow focused on the app component of your project.
- Developers can run it locally or in CI to:
  - Produce or refresh per‑file summaries that help new contributors quickly understand the codebase.
  - Generate release notes for a new version of the app and, if configured, share them with the team (for example, through a Teams message).
- By using Azure OpenAI, it integrates with enterprise Azure resources and a specific model deployment you control.

Key details and requirements
- Scope: Only processes files under app/ and saves docs there, keeping the rest of the repo untouched.
- Safety/limits: Only the first ~1500 characters of each file are summarized, so very long files may be summarized at a high level.
- Environment: Requires a .env (or equivalent environment variables) with:
  - OPENAI_API_KEY
  - OPENAI_API_BASE
  - OPENAI_API_VERSION
  - OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
  - TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL (optional)
- Typical use: From the project root, run: python generate_docs_and_release.py

What to expect as outputs
- Beginner‑friendly explanations for files in app/, saved alongside your code (filenames and exact placement depend on the rest of the script).
- A set of release notes describing recent changes to the app (and possibly a Teams notification if configured).
---### main.py

High-level purpose
- main.py is the entry point of the project. It’s the file you run to start the app.
- Its job is to coordinate the whole “automated release notes” process: watch a Git repository for changes, ask an AI (LLM) to draft release notes from those changes, and send the notes to Microsoft Teams.

What it does step by step
- Sets up logging so you can see what’s happening:
  - It prints messages to your terminal.
  - It also writes them to release_notes.log.
- Loads configuration using the Config module (things like repo location, polling interval, API keys, Teams webhook, etc.).
- Creates the core components:
  - GitMonitor: checks the Git repo for new commits.
  - LLMHandler: talks to the language model to turn commit info into readable release notes.
  - TeamsIntegration: posts the generated notes to a Teams channel.
- Remembers the “last processed commit” so it doesn’t send duplicate notes. It calls a helper method (_get_last_processed_commit) to retrieve that state when starting up.

How it likely runs
- Although the snippet is cut off, this kind of main file typically has a loop that:
  1) Polls the Git repo for new commits since last_commit_hash.
  2) If there are new changes, collects the relevant details (commit messages, PR titles, etc.).
  3) Asks the LLMHandler to produce a clean, human-friendly release note.
  4) Sends that note to Teams via TeamsIntegration.
  5) Updates last_commit_hash so the same commits aren’t processed again.
  6) Sleeps for a configured amount of time and repeats.

How it fits into the project
- main.py is the “orchestrator” or “conductor.” It doesn’t do the heavy lifting itself; instead, it connects specialized modules:
  - Config: reads settings that control how everything behaves.
  - GitMonitor: knows how to talk to Git and find new changes.
  - LLMHandler: knows how to call the AI and format the response.
  - TeamsIntegration: knows how to send messages to Teams.
- When you run the project, you run this file. It wires everything together and drives the overall workflow.

How to run it
- From a terminal: python3 main.py (it also has a Unix shebang so you can run it directly on Unix-like systems if it’s executable).
- Make sure the other modules (config.py, git_monitor.py, llm_handler.py, teams_integration.py) are present and any required environment variables or API keys are set as expected by Config.

What to look at next
- config.py to see what settings you can adjust.
- git_monitor.py to understand how commits are detected.
- llm_handler.py to see how release notes are generated and what model/settings are used.
- teams_integration.py to see how messages are sent to Teams (e.g., webhook URL, formatting).
---### genrate_for_this_repo.py

Here’s what this file is and how it fits into your project, in simple terms:

What this file is
- It’s a helper script that automatically writes documentation for your repository.
- Its name is genrate_for_this_repo.py, and you run it with: python genrate_for_this_repo.py.

What it does
- Looks through your repository and summarizes every file, except anything inside the app/ folder.
- Uses Azure OpenAI to create short, beginner-friendly summaries of those files.
- Updates the main README.md in the root of your repo with those summaries so newcomers can quickly understand what each file does.

How it works (behind the scenes)
- Loads your Azure OpenAI settings from a .env file (things like your API key and deployment name).
- Connects to Azure OpenAI using the openai library configured for Azure.
- For each non-app file, it calls a function (summarize_file) that asks Azure OpenAI to generate a simple explanation of that file.
- Collects those summaries and writes them into the root README.md, likely including a timestamp so you can see when it was last updated.

What you need before running it
- A .env file with:
  - OPENAI_API_KEY
  - OPENAI_API_BASE
  - OPENAI_API_VERSION
  - OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
- Python packages installed: openai and python-dotenv
- Internet access and an active Azure OpenAI deployment (usage may incur costs).

How it fits into the project
- It keeps your repository documentation up to date without manual effort.
- It focuses on the non-app parts of the codebase so you can maintain separate, possibly more detailed docs for the app/ directory if you want.
- It’s especially helpful for new contributors or reviewers who want a quick overview of what each file does.

Things to know
- It will modify the root README.md by adding or updating summaries. If you have custom sections in your README, consider backing it up or checking how the script structures its output.
- Large files or unusual formats may produce shorter or more generic summaries, depending on your Azure OpenAI settings and limits.
- If the .env values are missing or incorrect, the script won’t be able to connect to Azure OpenAI and will fail.

Quick start
- Install dependencies: pip install openai python-dotenv
- Create and fill in your .env with the required Azure settings.
- Run: python genrate_for_this_repo.py
- Check README.md at the root for the updated documentation.
---### update_readme.py

Here’s a plain-English overview of what update_readme.py is for and how it fits into your project.

What this file is for
- It’s a developer tool to keep your README.md up to date automatically.
- Instead of manually listing what each file in your app does and which packages your app uses, this script scans your code and writes those sections into the README for you.

What it does
- Looks through the app directory for Python files (.py).
- For each file, it reads the code and uses Python’s built-in AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to understand the structure safely (without executing the code).
- It extracts:
  - The module’s top-level docstring (a short description at the top of the file, if present).
  - A list of functions and classes defined in the file.
  - The imports used in the file (your dependencies).
- It then compiles:
  - A “summary” section for all files in app, likely listing each file with its functions/classes and any docstring info.
  - A “dependencies” section that aggregates the imports used across the app.
- It writes or updates these sections in README.md, probably including a timestamp so you know when it was last refreshed.

How it fits in the project
- It’s not part of the app’s runtime code. It’s a maintenance/documentation helper for developers.
- It helps new contributors quickly understand:
  - What files exist and what they contain (functions/classes).
  - What external libraries or modules the app relies on.
- It reduces manual effort and keeps docs consistent with the code as it changes.

How to use it
- From the project’s root directory, run: python update_readme.py
- The script uses only standard Python libraries (os, ast, pathlib, typing, datetime), so no extra installation should be needed.
- After running, check README.md to see the updated sections and commit the changes if they look good.

When to run it
- After adding or renaming files in the app directory.
- After adding or changing functions/classes.
- After adding/removing imports (dependencies).
- Before making a release or sharing the repo, to ensure the README reflects the current state.

Notes and limitations
- It only scans the app directory (by design).
- It needs valid Python files; if a file has syntax errors, analysis will fail for that file.
- It collects imports it can see in the code; dynamic or conditional imports might not be fully captured.
- The exact formatting of the README updates depends on the rest of the script (not shown here), but the intent is to insert or refresh the summary and dependency sections.

In short: update_readme.py is an automated documentation updater that reads your app’s code structure and dependencies and keeps your README’s overview sections current with minimal effort.
